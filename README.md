## Fundamentals of Bioinformatics, December 2020

This workshop will be delivered on December 14, 15, & 17 by the Data Analytics Core (DAC) of the [Center for Quantitative Biology at Dartmouth](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/). 

The DAC aims to facilitate advanced bioinformatic, computational, and statistical analysis of complex genomics data for the Dartmouth research community. 

If you have questions about this workshop, or would like to discuss data analysis services available from the Data Analytics Core, please visit our [website](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/projects-and-cores/data-analytics-core/), or email us at: DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu

### Workshop goals: 
- Develop a working understanding what Bioinformatic data analysis involves, how it is done, and what skills it requires
- Gain an appreciation for how next-generation sequencing data is generated (NGS) and how the information generated is stored
- Learn the major file-types used in bioinformatic data analysis and how to manipulate them
- Learn how to install standard bioinformatic software using *Conda*
- Understand the concepts of reference genomes and genome annotations and where to find them 
- Learn how to leverage the *Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)* for exploring genomics data 
- Gain a working knowledge of basic programming in R and how it can be used for Bioinformatics 
- Learn how to leverage high performance computing systems (HPCs) to perform Bioinformatic data-analysis
